  <h1 class="mt-4">Managing data resulting from Phantom Buster results</h1>
  <p>
    Hey! ðŸ˜„
    <br /><br />
    This is a brief tutorial to get the information resulting from Phantom
    Buster tasks. You will be able to manage the information in
    <a href="http://airtable.com">Airtable</a> or
    <a href="https://www.google.com/sheets/about/">Google Sheets</a> and get new
    entry updates while the Phantom Buster task is still running. <br /><br />
    To use this solution,
    <b
      >you need to have one Phantom Buster task running with at least one result
      in the CSV.</b
    >
    We will upload the information and keep updating the document every day
    automatically.
  </p>
  <h2 class="mt-4">Which one should you use?</h2>
  <h5 class="mt-4">Google Sheet form</h5>
  <p>
    This is the recommended one because it's simpler to use, you just need the
    Phantom Buster's CSV link and a Google Sheet link.
  </p>
  <h5 class="mt-4">Airtable form</h5>
  <p>
    This one is a little more complicated to use, and it fails easier than
    Google Sheets solution. Here, you will need to create the Airtable base
    yourself, import the header rows and change the name to the table.
    <br /><br />
    Why does it fail more easily? Because Phantom Buster tends to add more
    columns to the original CSV (from which we created the table in the first
    place) to reflect errors or any other information scrapped. The Airtable
    service does not allow us to create a new column or update the other data
    when it finds a column that is not mapped in the table.
    <br /><br />
    If you decide to use this solution anyway, and you notice the table is not
    updating daily, check the CSV directly in Phantom Buster. Look for the
    differences between header rows both from the CSV and the Airtable, if
    there's any difference, please update the Airtable. Then, wait one day to
    see if it works again, otherwise contact Techstars Miami team.
  </p>
  <h2 class="mt-4">Update search form</h2>
  <p>
    This is an additional solution that allows you to keep the Phantom Buster
    task scrapping new results.
    <br /><br />
    Let's say you created a search in LinkedIn Sales Navigator for new founders
    in MedellÃ­n, Colombia. By default, Phantom Buster will only scrape the
    original list of profiles that was shown the day you made the search. For
    example, if you did the search yesterday, and tomorrow someone adds
    "founder" in their profile, Phantom Buster will not scrape that profile even
    if the scrapper is still running.
    <br /><br />
    We found a way around this problem: since Phantom Buster receives a
    spreadsheet with a list of LinkedIn search urls, we automatically add the
    same link to the spreadsheet with a slight difference every day, that way
    the new results will be scraped. Please note that Phantom Buster has a limit
    of 2,500 profiles per search, so after that number, you could notice
    duplicates in your table.
