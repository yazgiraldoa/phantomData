  <h1 class="mt-4">Managing data resulting from Phantom Buster results</h1>
  <p>
    Hey! ðŸ˜„
    <br><br>
    This is a brief tutorial to get the information resulting from Phantom Buster tasks.
    You will be able to manage the information in <a href="http://airtable.com">Airtable</a> or
    <a href="https://www.google.com/sheets/about/">Google Sheets</a> and get new entry updates
    while the Phantom Buster task is still running.
    <br><br>
    To use this solution, <b>you need to have one Phantom Buster task running with at least one result in the CSV.</b>
    We will upload the information and keep updating the document every day automatically.
  </p>
  <h2 class="mt-4">Which one should you use?</h2>
  <h5 class="mt-4">Google Sheet form</h5>
  <p>
    This is the recommended one because it's simpler to use, you just need
    the Phantom Buster's CSV link and a Google Sheet link.
  </p>
  <h5 class="mt-4">Airtable form</h5>
  <p>
    This one is a little more complicated to use, and it fails easier than Google Sheets solution.
    Here, you will need to create the Airtable base yourself, import the header rows and change the name to the table.
    <br><br>
    Why does it fail more easily? Because Phantom Buster tends to add more columns to the original CSV
    (from which we created the table in the first place) to reflect errors or any other information scrapped.
    The Airtable service does not allow us to create a new column or update the other data when it finds a column
    that is not mapped in the table.
    <br><br>
    If you decide to use this solution anyway, and you notice the table is not updating daily, check the CSV directly in
    Phantom Buster. Look for the differences between header rows both from the CSV and the Airtable,
    if there's any difference, please update the Airtable. Then, wait one day to see if it works again, otherwise contact
    Techstars Miami team.
  </p>
  <h2 class="mt-4">Update search form</h2>
  <p>
    This is an additional solution that allows you to keep the Phantom Buster task scrapping new results.
    <br><br>
    Let's say you created a search in LinkedIn Sales Navigator for new founders in MedellÃ­n, Colombia.
    By default, Phantom Buster will only scrape the original list of profiles that was shown the day you made the search.
    For example, if you did the search yesterday, and tomorrow someone adds "founder" in their profile, Phantom Buster
    will not scrape that profile even if the scrapper is still running.
    <br><br>
    We found a way around this problem: since Phantom Buster receives a spreadsheet with a list of LinkedIn search urls,
    we automatically add the same link to the spreadsheet with a slight difference every day, that way the new results
    will be scraped. Please note that Phantom Buster has a limit of 2,500 profiles per search, so after that number,
    you could notice duplicates in your table.
